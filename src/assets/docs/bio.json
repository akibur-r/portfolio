    "I’m a final-year Computer Science undergrad at Port City International University, passionate about building web apps and solving analytical problems.",
    "Recently, I have built some full-stack projects with intuitive user interfaces using MERN stack.",
    "Over the past few years, I’ve participated in 12 divisional and national-level programming contests, including ICPCs, NCPC, and IUPCs. Preparing for these contests helped me develop a grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms, along with fundamentals of CS. I'm rated Pupil on Codeforces and 3★ on CodeChef. I enjoy solving analytical problems and pushing my brain to the limit.",
    "Outside tech, I enjoy movies, TV series, and astronomy."
